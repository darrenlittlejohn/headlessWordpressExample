This site is an example of using a Headless\Decoupled Wordpress installation. The front end is built with React which calls a WP API to access the Wordpress back end.

The tutorial used for this project is:

The author makes the case for using the Headless Wordpress setup:

Why Headless WordPress?

Okay, so WordPress is great. React is great. So why should we combine the two?

JavaScript is the future of WordPress. In late 2015, Automattic, the company behind WordPress, re-wrote their entire admin application (codenamed “Calypso”) in JavaScript. And a few weeks later, Matt Mullenweg, CEO of Automattic, gave a massive homework assignment to all WordPress developers: “learn JavaScript, deeply.”

Because a frontend/backend split is good for the world — both users and developers. Better user experiences are possible. Maintaining large codebases is more efficient. Better performance.

Your company can hire more specialized talent. Frontend engineers don’t have to know WordPress and vice-versa. Instead of hiring a generalist WordPress theme/plugin developer, you can hire separate roles who each have a deep knowledge of frontend engineering and Wordpress, respectively.

I'm open to discussion on the usefullness of this application. Please fork the repo and put together your own version or copy it and show me your results.
